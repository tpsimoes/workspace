                            Deploy a Windows VM, a jumpbox VM in your SAP HANA VNET, to in one shoot run the tool: 
                            https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sap/workloads/sap-hana-high-availability

                                        

Pre-Requirements 
To create the infrasture for run SAP on Azure, you need to have already:
- An Azure Subsciption 
- A SAP HANA installation  on a SUSE Azure VM
- Azure Storage Account to store the HANA VMs ssh keys and the generated HTML reports
- WSL Ubuntu on a Local Machine (in case you dont have - just need to adapt to your system where the tool wslview opens the generated HTML reports)

Assumptions
Currently this script is design to work on a SAP HANA High Availability Arquitecture:
- For a typical Repro with two VMs - please use the https://github.com/tpsimoes/workspace/blob/master/SAPonAzure/Quality-Check-HANA-on-SLES/qualityCheck.sh
- To check a list/Subnet of Hana VMs - please use the https://github.com/tpsimoes/workspace/blob/master/SAPonAzure/Quality-Check-HANA-on-SLES/qualityCheckVnet.sh
